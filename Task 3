                <h2>Carrier</h2>
                <p>Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting
                    at McKinsey & Company.Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and
                    innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and
                    ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the
                    development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a
                    demonstration of ChromeOS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released
                    to the public in 2012.[29] On May 20, 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec
                    VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.

                    On March 13, 2013, Pichai added Android to the list of Google products that he oversaw. Android was
                    formerly managed by Andy Rubin, who was a director of Jive Software from April 2011 to July 30,
                    2013.Pichai was selected to become the next CEO of Google on August 10, 2015,after previously being
                    appointed Product Chief by CEO, Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at
                    the completion of the formation of Alphabet Inc., the new holding company for the Google company
                    family.

                    Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft's CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually
                    given to Satya Nadella. In August 2017, Pichai drew publicity for firing a Google employee who wrote
                    a ten-page manifesto criticizing the company's pro-diversity policies.
